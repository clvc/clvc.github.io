								<h3 class="major">Large Scale Neural-Simulations</h3>	
								<p>Working with the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo I experimented with possible optimization methods for biologically plausible nerual simulations.
									I built networks which learned how to acheive tasks ranging from simple multiplication to compression of images. In addition I led an investigation
									into optimizing very large models that could acheive complex tasks (like associative memory) by optimizing the sub-networks within them. 
								</p>
								<h3 class="major">Segmentation of Aerial Imagery</h3>	
								<p>While working for Heliolytics Inc. I pioneered the development of deep learning convolutional neural networks to segment aerial imagery.
									The models developed automate the analysis of solar panels allowing analysts to work faster and focus on edge cases rather than easily analyzed panels.

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A Mechatronics Enginering Student by education but an AI developer by trade.
									I was drawn to robotics by its ability to augment or replace the physical abilities of humans.
									The concept of making people better at what they do or even replacing them entirely has always driven me to learn the inner workings of machines and processes.
								</p>
								<p>
									What robotics does for a person's body, AI does for their mind. The ability to identify trends, make predictions, and learn is what seperates artifial intellegence from every piece of technology that has come before.
									The minute I peared into this wonderful field I was drawn in and have been down the rabit hole ever since. I want to understand how the amazing systems we are able to build work, and to integrate knowledge from other fields to develop new methods and applications.
									Deep learning has the potential to transform almost every aspect of human life, and I intend to be part of that transformation.
