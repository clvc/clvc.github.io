                                <p>Microscopes represent one of the most flexible sensing instruments available. Working with Professor Roarke Horstmeyer I developed systems and strategies to use machine learning to optimize how microscopes sesnse their environment. We have explored this concept through modifications to the lens as well as to illumination.</p>
                                <h3 class="major">Movement Signal Processing</h3>
                                <p>Worked with Professor Arash Arami at the University of Waterloo to link concepts within reinforcement learning and neuromechanics. Developed new techniques for policy exploration which are inspired by the Muscle Synergy Hypothesis.</p>
                                <h3 class="major">Staged Training to Predict Sea Ice Concentration</h3>	     
                                <p>Working with professor K. Andrea Scott at the University of Waterloo I developed deep learning training strategies to predict the sea ice concentration of Synaptive Aperature Radar images.
                                    We guided the training of CNNs by utilizing staged learning. We injected noise into the base image during training and gradually reduced it over several epochs.
                                    This led to the CNN learning feature based patterns prior to texture based and stopped the CNN from being stuck in a conceptual minima.

                                <h3 class="major">Augmented Solar Analysis</h3>	
                                <p>While working for Heliolytincs Inc. I integrated the results of Aerial Image Segmentation into analysis workflows. 
                                    I utilized known spatial information of the solar panels as well as adaptive pattern recognition to combine information 
                                    from multiple aerial viewpoints and empowered analysts to focus on identification rather than localization. 
								</p>
								<h3 class="major">Large Scale Neural-Simulations</h3>	
								<p>Working with the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of Waterloo I experimented with possible optimization methods for biologically plausible nerual simulations.
									I built networks which learned how to acheive tasks ranging from simple multiplication to compression of images. In addition I led an investigation
									into optimizing very large models that could acheive complex tasks (like associative memory) by optimizing the sub-networks within them. 
								</p>
								<h3 class="major">Segmentation of Aerial Imagery</h3>	
								<p>While working for Heliolytics Inc. I pioneered the development of deep learning convolutional neural networks to segment aerial imagery.
									The models developed automate the analysis of solar panels allowing analysts to work faster and focus on edge cases rather than easily analyzed panels.

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A Mechatronics Enginering Student by education but an AI developer by trade.
									I was drawn to robotics by its ability to augment or replace the physical abilities of humans.
									The concept of making people better at what they do or even replacing them entirely has always driven me to learn the inner workings of machines and processes.
                                </p>
								<p>
                                        What robotics does for a person's body, AI does for their mind. The ability to identify trends, make predictions, and learn is what seperates artifial intellegence from every piece of technology that has come before. At the same time however, AI is limited. 
                                    </p>
                               <ul>
    <li>AI is inefficient. Humans underestimate our ability to be mediocre at things. We are fantastic at learning to do "fine" extremelly quickly. Humans learn on the order of tens of examples, where AI learns from tens of thousands.</li>
    <li>AI is brittle. Trials outside the training set can often break systems. Deep neural networks in particular are often vulnerable to over-fitting, as well as adversial approaches.</li>
    <li>AI is opaque. It is often difficult to understand the decisions a deep neural network makes, or the trends it learns. We may not even realize that the system we have created is  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05589"> burdened by its own complexity</a>. 
    </ul>
    
    AI's limitations are exciting. Each one of them presents an opportunity to advance the field, to make machines smarter.
